## Challenges
I thought we had to write the summary by hand, so I have  written 3 pages. Then I realized a digital version was potentially better, I tried to extract the most important Information from my written notes in order to make a .md file. I wanted to include pictures, but there was unfortunately not time left, since Matteo and I have decided to try out the first examples in Julia, where we changed the number of epochs and batch size within a simple single layer perceptron.
