# Protocol for day3
## Targets of the day
  - [x] Start off with Julia
  - [x] Stand up Meeting
  - [x] Working on OCR paper
  - [x] Writing .md summary or OCR paper

## What IÂ´ve learned
 - Certain aspects of Julia
 - Information of the paper

## Challenges
Partly, it was difficult to follow the paper, when the authors implemented their work.
Also, to summarize most relevant Information out of a paper concerned with everything we need for our project was more difficult than expected.
