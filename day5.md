# Protocol for day 5
## Targets of the day
  - [x] Stand up Meeting
  - [x] TensorFlow Tutorial

## What IÂ´ve learned
 - How to work with TensorFlow on simple ML projects with certain datasets
 - Important aspects on understanding data: before implementing the model, data has to be well understood
 - Theory on Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning and Reinforcement Learning
 - Basics on simple models like linear regression etc...

## Challenges
Some aspects within the course were not clear enough for me, so I have decided to focus on the documentation on the TensorFlow website. There, I was able to solve some problems of understanding.
