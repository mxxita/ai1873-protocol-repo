# Protocol for day 7
## Targets of the day
  - [x] Stand up Meeting
  - [x] Working with Examples in Flux
  - [x] Working with Julia

## What IÂ´ve learned
 - I have tried to understand the code of the perceptron and CNN

## Challenges
There was an error in my code of CNN, so I have spent a ridiculous amount of time trying to solve it.
Then, I tried to start with Flux differently in order to spend some time in a productive manner. So I have looked at the Flux.jl Website for some further input on how to use Flux for ML.

I wanted to go into further detail with Julia on the following day, but something came up, so I could only work 25h this week.
