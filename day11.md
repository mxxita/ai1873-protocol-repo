# Protocol for day 7
## Targets of the day
  - [x] Stand up Meeting
  - [x] Finishing UCL lecture presentation
  - [x] Research and summary of potential execution of pipeline

## What IÂ´ve learned
 - What challenges we will have to face when working with Kurrentschrift
 - Different strategies on how to extract features from segmented characters in order to classify them correctly

## Challenges
Since Kurrentschrift has certain properties (similarities in chars, overlaps, interconnection of neighbouring chars, chars are often ambiguous --> context information required, missing or poorly written chars)

We need to extract shape information and include contextual information
