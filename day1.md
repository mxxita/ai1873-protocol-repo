# Protocol for day1
## Part 1: First Meeting 09:00 am
We have discussed how we want to structure week 1 and defined targets. In terms of hitting these, we have a checklist available in the ai1873 repository.
## Targets of the day
[x] Creating a presentation for the Kick off meeting on the following day
[x] Reading the articles on OCR and understanding them
[x] Getting to know GitHub workflow
[ ] Creating a portfolio Website with GitHub Pages
[ ] optional: Starting off with Julia

## Creating the presentation
Matteo and I have discussed what to include in the presentation on the slide describing our project. We managed to come up with valid points, but underestimated the knowledge required to establish good slides. Therefore, we decided to read the following articles in order to finish this part.

## Reading the articles
There was a 3 page long blog post on the basics of OCR and challenges associated with creating a pipeline. We found out that the presumably most challenging part of our project will be character segmentation, since in "Korrentschrift" characters are normally connected with each other. Here we will need to figure out a way to prevent over- or under- segmentation.

## Getting to know GitHub and Git
The goal was to get the hang of the GitHub workflow. I started with some basic tutorials on how to establish a website with GitHub Pages. I did have problems with getting to know how to work with Git and found out that it was smart to start with installing everything I need in order to work with Git. So I have installed Git Bash and watched tutorials on YouTube to understand the syntax associated with it. I also wanted to work with Atom, so I have tried to set it up on my laptop, which I unfortunately have not figured out completely on day1.

## Setting up the website
In terms of setting up my portfolio website, I have watched some tutorials on YouTube to see how to work with GitHub Pages. I also wanted to work with HUGO, but I could not figure out how to implement in properly. For this reason, I have decided to postpone further work on my website to the following day.

## Julia
I have not started working with Julia, but I am planning to do so tomorrow.
