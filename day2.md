  - [~] Getting to know Julia with Tutorials
  - [] Working on the 2 Problems with Julia

## Finishing my Website
Since I have not finished working on my website I started off with installing everything necessary for working with Git on my Laptop.
So I managed to wrap my head around Git Bash and Atom, as well as connecting everything to GitHub. Matteo helped me with some issues so I could start working. As I have learned the workflow associated with Git, I thought it was more useful to keep my website quite simple, since the goal was getting to know our working environment.
Therefore, I will further my Website when there is time left with HUGO.

## Meeting 2 at 11:30 am.
In this meeting we got some tasks to work on with Julia and discussed what we have done so far.

## Kick off Meeting
Meeting + connections...

## Getting to know Julia
First I run into issues associated with Julia on Atom, because the PATH for Julia was not specified. This took me a while to figure out unfortunately.
So I have started to work with Julia and its syntax with the concise tutorial from the GitHub repository. I was not able to finish every aspect of it, since it took quite a while to install everything on my PC.

## Working on the 2 Problems
I have not started them ...
